This project is currently **in progress**.

The **objective** is to develop automated tools that extract insights from street-level imagery. The initial focus will be the improvement of planning information for climate-related disaster risk reduction in urban areas. This project will establish a foundation for future plans to transition into post-disaster impact assessments.
