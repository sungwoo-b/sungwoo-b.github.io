- **Tags**: 
    - Tags are elements like `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<a>`.
    - They define the structure of a web page.
- **Opening Tag**: 
    - Tags start with an opening tag, such as `<p>`.
- **Closing Tag**: 
    - Most tags have a closing tag, such as `</p>`.
    - Some tags, like `<img>`, are self-closing.
